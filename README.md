# TraVaGen
This repository contains supplementary material and the implementation of the TraVaGen project, a privatized event log generating framework introduced in the paper "Releasing Differentially Private Event Logs Using Generative Models".

## Structure

The information is structured as follows:

* experiments: contains results and input data of the experimental analysis
* implementation: contains the codebase of the generating framework
* supplementary: contains supplementary material for the paper

## Notes

In particular, the network training and the data utility metrics can be computationally expensive to compute. Hence, we advise to ensure sufficient CPU-, GPU- and memory resources.
Any feedback is expected to arrive at `frederik.wangelik@rwth-aachen.de`.
